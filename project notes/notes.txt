Function prototypes

Using Scanner input for everything. Use regex to create input constraints.

No syso in this entire project. use log.

User: //Ask if user is customer or employee (user enter 1 or 2)

login() //for customer or employee

	//customer logins with email and password
	//employee logins with Employee ID and Employee Password
	//forgot login credentials? not taken care of here. //Go to branch message for customer. //contact supervisor for employee

register() //create new customer account, checkings or savings
	//ask for name,SSN, email and password (regex to check all)
	//email will be the check to prevent duplicates
	//produces 12 digit user account id
	//produces 9 digit unique account number for created accounts (checking/savings)

*focus less on user stories so not too much personal info for this exercise.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Customer://once user is logged into a customer account

	//customer limit 2 accounts, checking and savings, 1 of each
	//fast transaction between user's own accounts

openAccount() //checks for existence of account. deny duplicates. some logic here to make second account setup faster
	//optional initial deposit
	//limit 1 checking and 1 savings


viewBalance() //prints balance from selected account

withdraw()//withdraw from selected account

deposit() //deposit to selected account

transfer() //move funds between user's own account if they have checkings and savings

sendMoney() //sends money to other account numbers within the database
	//user must enter receiver account number and that account owner full name
	//deplete from sender account and update account value

receiveMoney() //receives money when sendMoney() performs a valid transaction
		//update account money value by adding sendMoney() value
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Employee: 
	//employee users manually entered into database. 
	//Could make seperate Admin App where employee accounts are updated in database	

approveAccount()//approve or reject a user created account

viewAccount() //view total account info from entered account. 
		//Only need to know 12 digit user's account number to get instant result
		//can call viewLogs() to get user specific transactions once in account
		
viewLogs() //view transactions. 2 options
	//accept user account number input 
	//if no input then from entire DB
	//10 most recent
	//all
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System: //automated

ValidateTransaction() //called to make sure transactions are valid with some logic

accountCheck() //will be called before being sent to approveAccount(). Auto Denial stage

		//current logic is 1 account per user. 1 email and 1 name and 1 ssn.
		//duplicates of ssn or email are forbidden. Return some error statement
